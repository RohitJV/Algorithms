# Algorithms

These are the list of Algorithms I have implemented with sufficient documentation in comments.
Most of the implementations are based on sources available online (references mentioned in the comments).

Almost all implementations are ready-to-use for competitive programming contests.

List of algorithms:
1) Range Minimum Query : 
* <O(NlogN), O(1)>
* <O(N), O(sqrt(N))>
2) Least Common Ancestor : 
* <O(N), O(sqrt(N))>
* <O(NlogN), O(logN)>
